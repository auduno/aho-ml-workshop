AHO ML / AI Workshop
====================

Code and links to relevant course materials for the AHO ML/AI workshop.

For the workshop we recommend using a modern browser, such as Chrome, Safari or Microsoft Edge.

For those of you who are interested in writing code, it's possible to use either Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Mac), but we recommend downloading a more advanced code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

If you want to test the code in this repository, you'll need to set up a local webserver. You can do this by either using the Chrome extension [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en):

* install the Chrome extension [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
* Start the extension
* Click `choose folder` and point to the folder with these files.

or using [Python](https://www.python.org/) (which should be installed by default on Mac) :

* Open `Terminal` app
* Browse to the folder with these files via `cd` command
* run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8887`

After this, you should be able to go to `http://localhost:8887` and browse the files in this folder.
